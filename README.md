# Delayed SubModule Support for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, courtesy of the Community Patch project

Mods can add a `<DelayedSubModule>` element containing traditional `<SubModules>` that will be only loaded after the first tick of the game.
 
This also allows delay loaded mods to refer to other modules' assemblies, such as SandBox's SandBox.ViewModelCollection.dll etc.
